# General Problem Solving Advice

## Problem Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem**\
   \- Restate the problem in your own words\
   \- Understand the inputs and the desired outputs\
   \- Do you have enough information to solve the problem?\
   \- Have you seen this (or a similar) problem before?\
   \- Have you seen a related problem that might give insight to form a plan?\

2. **Have concrete examples to check your understanding of the problem**\
   **-** Draw a diagram\
   \- Can you come up with test cases?\
   \- User Stories (given an input what should the output be?)\
   \- Think about edge cases (empty inputs, missing inputs etc)\

3. **Break a solution down into steps (make a plan)**\
   **-** What other algorithms or data structures do you know that might be useful for this problem?\
   **-** Write it in plain english or pseudo code before translating your plan into code\

4. **Solve or Simplify**\
   **-** If you can't solve immediately by following the plan. Can you simplify by ignoring part of the problem and focusing on a smaller part?\
   \- Can you think of a similar problem which you can solve first and use that information towards the original problem?\

5. **Look back and refactor**\
   **-** Can you check the result via test cases?\
   \- Can you understand it at a glance?\
   \- Can you improve the performance of the solution (time or space complexity)?\
   \- Always review how other people have solved this problem.\


#### Note on practice

The aim of this game is to have expose yourself to as many problems as possible and understand the solutions. After enough exposure, your knowledge of previous problems will help solving new problems, so don't be afraid to give up on solving a problem after an hour or so and review the solution. Make sure you understand it, and move on to the next one. \
\
The general theory here is: There are only a finite number of ways to ask a question on a specific topic. The more you've seen and been exposed to, the more familiar you'll feel when presented with a problem that's similar but not one you've seen before. **You are trying to become a master of spotting patterns.**
