### Why use recursion?

It gives you another tool to solve problems, where the iterative solution might not be optimal. It will be used often with object traversal, and is sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration.



### Using recursion

Recursive functions are invoked with **different inputs** until you reach a **base case**.

Base case: The condition where the recursion stops.
