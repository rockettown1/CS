# Heaps

For the examples here we will start by looking at a Binary heap.

### Binary Heap

A binary heap is very similar to a binary search tree but it has different rules. There are two types we' will look at - a Max Binary Heap and a Min Binary Heap.

Max Binary Heap: Parent nodes are always larger than their children.

Min Binary Heap: Parent nodes are always smaller than their children.

It still follows the binary rule that each node can have (at max) two children. There is no order to the left or the right. A binary heap takes up the least amount of space as possible, namely that each child space is filled before moving down a level.
