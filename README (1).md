# Big O

## Time Complexity

Length of time an algorithm runs based on input size. Talking about average case scenario.

Constant Time - time doesn't increase with input O(1)

Linear Time - time increases at the same rate as input O(n)

Quadratic Time - nested loops are at least O(n^2)

## Spacial Complexity

How much memory/RAM/hard-disk space will used?

We want to avoid linear spacial complexity.
